- `gzip` is used to compress files
- `gzip -d` and `gunzip` is used to decompress files

*ZIP*: This is commonly used in Windows systems and is known for its ability to hold multiple files in a single compressed package (archive).

*GZIP*: This is commonly used in Unix and Linux systems. GZIP compresses a single file only, however, it can be used in conjunction with TAR to compress multiple files (creating a .tar.gz file).
