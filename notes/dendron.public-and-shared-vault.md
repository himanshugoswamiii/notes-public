To make public and shared vault

1. Create a local vault : Add your content to it

2. Create a git repo : Do no commit anything to it now

3. Use the command `Dendron: Convert vault` and simply copy the link to your git repo
> Dendron will automatically make the git files and will make the first commit in the `master` branch

4. See your github repo and check if all the notes are present
5. Use `Dendron: Wordspace Sync` to sync all the notes in their repo


### Imp : For me
If you want to share all the notes in another machine, then in your workspace folder initialze a git repo (like how we normally do)
