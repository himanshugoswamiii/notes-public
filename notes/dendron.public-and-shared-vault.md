To make public and shared vault

1. Create a local vault : Add your content to it

2. Create a git repo : Do no commit anything to it now

3. Use the command `Dendron: Convert vault` and simply copy the link to your git repo
> Dendron will automatically make the git files and will make the first commit in the `master` branch

4. See your github repo and check if all the notes are present
5. Use `Dendron: Wordspace Sync` to sync all the notes in their repo


### Imp : For me
If you want to share all the notes in another machine, then in your workspace folder initialze a git repo (like how we normally do)

### Wow point

Once you've have cloned your workspace (from github) in your other device you don't have to do anything like git clone in the remote repo. Dendron will automatically clone your files in the remote repo

> i.e this is the best workflow for using multiple repo for different vaults
