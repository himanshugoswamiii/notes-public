> Imp :
> > ssh-agent will cause a problem in windows. You can solve it by simply using git bash and adding ssh-keys to ssh-agent from it

### 1. Generate SSH Keys

Instructions given on github

### 2. Adding SSH Keys to ssh-agent

#### 2.1 In windows

> Imp : To install the SSH Agent on windows you need administator permissions to open **powershell as administrator**

#### 2.2 Using `git bash`

```bash
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This `id_rsa` is your private key

### 3. Pasting SSH Keys to Github

You'll be pasting your public key


Now if you clone from git bash it'll work perfectly but from windows it won't due to ssh-agent problem
